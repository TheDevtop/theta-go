# (Θ list processor)

**Theta** is a list processor, inspired by ELisp, written in Go.

### On building Theta

To build Theta, execute: `$ make build`

This should produce the `./bin/theta` and `./bin/threpl` executables.

### On installing Theta

To install Theta, execute: `$ cp ./bin/* /usr/local/bin/`

### On using Theta

_Currently under construction..._

### On naming Theta

The reasons for the name are twofold:

There are many computer science concepts referencing greek letters:
- Raspberry **Pi**
- **Lambda** calculus
- **Zeta** Lisp
- The Emacs logo (**ξ**)

My initials are **TH**, which is the loose phonetic transcription of the letter **Θ**.
